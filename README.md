# Stock market scanner
A Scanner tool that filters stocks and computes their ATR

The scanner updates information on each stock ticker in a background thread using Yfinance and Polygon.io APIs (it needs two because either has its limitations and may not work sometimes). The tool is powered by a shell-type interface.

Made for self-education purposes.
